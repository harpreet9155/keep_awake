# Keep Awake
This project uses a small python script to keep the screen awake by moving the mouse when you're away. The frequency of mouse movement can be provided as a user argument in minutes (if not provided, default value of 3 minutes is used).

# Dependencies
This project uses PyAutoGui https://github.com/asweigart/pyautogui for the mouse control.
